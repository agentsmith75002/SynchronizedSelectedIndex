# SynchronizedSelectedIndex
Items collection control working together

The idea is to use XAML because integration is the job of 'blend team'.

I display the selectedIndex of the different controls :
- shortcutList (top)
- flipView
- subMenuList

Some parts of the XAML are inherited from the real project, sorry for Canvas and so on ;-)
